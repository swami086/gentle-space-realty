## Comment 1: ✅ COMPLETED - Admin Client Browser Usage Fix

**Issue:** "Do not use admin client from browser services; supabaseAdmin may be null causing runtime errors"

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Created server API routes for all admin operations:
  - `/pages/api/storage/upload.js` - File upload operations
  - `/pages/api/storage/delete.js` - File deletion operations  
  - `/pages/api/storage/signed-url.js` - Signed URL generation
  - `/pages/api/testimonials/admin.js` - Admin testimonial operations
  - `/pages/api/testimonials/stats.js` - Testimonial statistics
- ✅ Refactored `uploadService.ts` to use server API routes instead of direct admin client
- ✅ Refactored `testimonialService.ts` to use server API routes for admin operations
- ✅ Maintained public operations using regular client with RLS policies

**Impact:** Eliminates browser-side admin client usage, preventing runtime errors and security risks.

## Comment 2: ✅ COMPLETED - Admin Client Environment Handling

**Issue:** "Fix admin client environment handling for proper server/browser context detection"

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Enhanced production detection with multiple indicators:
  - Vite environment variables (`NODE_ENV`, `PROD`, `MODE`)
  - Build indicators (hostname checks)
  - PM2 detection for server context
- ✅ Improved service key handling with context-aware environment access
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging with proper context information
- ✅ Implemented fallback strategies for environment variable access

**Impact:** Robust environment detection prevents configuration issues across different deployment scenarios.

## Comment 3: ✅ COMPLETED - Remove Hardcoded Secrets

**Issue:** "Remove hardcoded secrets from ecosystem.config.cjs and create environment validation script"

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded secrets from `ecosystem.config.cjs`
- ✅ Updated configuration to use environment variables exclusively
- ✅ Created `scripts/validate-env.js` for environment validation
- ✅ Added comprehensive environment variable documentation
- ✅ Implemented security warnings for missing critical variables

**Impact:** Eliminates security risks from hardcoded secrets and provides validation for proper configuration.

## Comment 4: ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced OAuth Callback

**Issue:** "Enhanced OAuth callback with explicit code exchange"

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Enhanced `googleAuthService.ts` with explicit authorization code exchange
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for OAuth flow steps
- ✅ Implemented step-by-step validation:
  1. URL hash processing for code extraction
  2. Explicit authorization code exchange
  3. Session validation and user authentication
- ✅ Added detailed logging for OAuth debugging
- ✅ Enhanced error messages for better troubleshooting

**Impact:** More robust OAuth flow with better error handling and explicit code exchange process.

---

## Comment 5: ✅ COMPLETED - Production Detection & Debug Options

**Issue:** "Fix production detection and remove invalid debug options"

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Fixed production detection logic with multiple environment indicators
- ✅ Removed invalid `DEBUG_OAUTH_FLOW` environment variable option
- ✅ Updated debug configuration to use valid Vite environment variables:
  - `VITE_DEBUG_AUTH`
  - `VITE_DEBUG_SUPABASE`
- ✅ Enhanced context-aware debug logging
- ✅ Improved environment variable validation

**Impact:** Proper production detection and valid debug configuration options.

---

## Comment 6: ✅ COMPLETED - RLS Policy Verification

**Issue:** "Verify RLS policies for user operations"

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Used Supabase MCP tools to verify RLS policies:
  - `mcp__supabase__list_tables` - Verified table structure
  - `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` - Checked existing policies
- ✅ Created comprehensive RLS policy fix migration:
  - `database/migrations/011_fix_rls_policies.sql`
- ✅ Applied missing policies for admin operations:
  - Admin delete policies for inquiries
  - Service role policies for testimonials
  - Enhanced admin access controls
- ✅ Successfully applied migration using `mcp__supabase__apply_migration`
- ✅ Verified policies work correctly for both user and admin operations

**Impact:** Proper RLS policies ensure secure data access for all user roles and admin operations.

---

## Comment 7: ✅ COMPLETED - Remove Unused Imports & API Contracts

**Issue:** "Remove unused imports and maintain API contracts"

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Verified no unused imports across all modified files:
  - `src/lib/supabaseAdminClient.ts`
  - `src/services/uploadService.ts`  
  - `src/services/testimonialService.ts`
  - `src/services/googleAuthService.ts`
- ✅ Maintained all existing API contracts:
  - Upload service methods unchanged for external consumers
  - Testimonial service public methods preserved
  - Admin store integration points maintained
- ✅ Verified internal refactoring doesn't break external interfaces
- ✅ All tests and integrations remain functional

**Impact:** Clean codebase with no unused imports while maintaining full API compatibility.

---

## Comment 8: ✅ COMPLETED - Storage Key Migration

**Issue:** "Handle storageKey migration"

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive storage key migration utility:
  - `src/utils/storageKeyMigration.ts` - Complete migration framework
- ✅ Implemented graceful migration from legacy keys:
  - `gentle-space-realty-admin` (original)
  - `gentle-space-realty-admin-v1` (version 1)
  - `supabase.auth.token` (default Supabase)
  - `sb-auth-token` (common pattern)
- ✅ Current key: `gentle-space-realty-admin-v2`
- ✅ Features implemented:
  - Automatic migration detection
  - Data preservation during migration
  - Legacy key cleanup after successful migration
  - Migration status tracking and verification
  - Error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Integrated migration into admin client initialization
- ✅ Created verification script: `scripts/verify-storage-migration.js`
- ✅ Tested all migration scenarios successfully

**Impact:** Seamless storage key migration ensures existing user sessions are preserved during updates.
