## Warnings and Recommendations

### Build Warnings (Non-Critical)
1. **Large Bundle Size**: 745.22 kB bundle exceeds 500kB warning threshold
   - **Recommendation**: Implement code splitting with dynamic imports
   - **Impact**: Performance optimization opportunity, not blocking

2. **Dynamic Import Optimization**: Several modules imported both dynamically and statically
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize import patterns for better chunking
   - **Impact**: Bundle optimization opportunity, not blocking

3. **NODE_ENV in .env**: Production NODE_ENV in .env file not recommended
   - **Recommendation**: Remove from .env and set in build process
   - **Impact**: Best practices improvement, not blocking

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based code splitting for better performance
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Use bundle analyzer to identify optimization opportunities
3. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
4. **Service Worker**: Add service worker for offline functionality
